# Instawalk

## Summary

A web app made for Google's spatial language recognition challenge. This is a crowdsourcing 
challenge used to gather data on text descriptions of walking tours
from the real world. Users will select a tour and provide image and written directions 
on how to get from point A to point B. Once a user completes a tour they will be 
rewarded with interesting places, and the most Instagrammable parts of San Francisco.
